# Ensilog.Engagebay
Welcome to the Ensilog.Engagebay repository! This is a C# wrapper for the EngageBay API, designed to make it easy to interact with the API from your C# projects.
> Note: This project is a work in progress. We appreciate any feedback, contributions, or comments you may have.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Ensilog.Engagebay, you'll need to install the package from NuGet. You can do this from the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio, or by using the dotnet CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package Ensilog.Engagebay
```

Once you have the package installed, you can start using it in your project. Here's an example of how to create a new instance of the EngageBayClient:

```csharp
using Ensilog.Engagebay;

var apiKey = "your_api_key_here";
var engageBayClient = new EngageBayClient(apiKey);
```

## Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the Ensilog.Engagebay to interact with the EngageBay API:

### Creating a Contact

```csharp
using Ensilog.Engagebay;
using Ensilog.Engagebay.Contacts;

var contact = new Contact
{
    FirstName = "John",
    LastName = "Doe",
    Email = "john.doe@example.com"
};

try
{
    var createdContact = await engageBayClient.CreateContactAsync(contact);
    Console.WriteLine($"Created contact with ID: {createdContact.Id}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error creating contact: {ex.Message}");
}
```

### Retrieving a Contact by ID
```csharp
using Ensilog.Engagebay;
using Ensilog.Engagebay.Contacts;

long contactId = 12345; // Replace with a valid contact ID
try
{
    var retrievedContact = await engageBayClient.GetContactByIdAsync(contactId);
    Console.WriteLine($"Retrieved contact with name: {retrievedContact.FirstName} {retrievedContact.LastName}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error retrieving contact: {ex.Message}");
}
```

## Current development status
The Ensilog.Engagebay is currently in development and I'm doing this on my spare time. I intend to finalize a version 1.0 with all the listed feature of the official Engage bay documentation
Here is the status of the implemented endpoints in this wrapper. ✅ means that the endpoint is implemented, ❌ means that it is not implemented, and 🚧 means that the class is existing but there are some issues using it that I did not have the time to investigate into.

## Disclaimer
I tried to optimize my time on this project, so I extensively used the new AI tools we have now at our disposal in this project (ChatGPT, Github copilot mainly). Feel free to open an issue if you find any weird stuff whether it being in the code or in the documentation.
I normally check eveything that went out of the AI, but I might have missed something 😄
